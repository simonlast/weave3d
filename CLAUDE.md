# Claude Instructions

## Project: Weave Pattern Simulator

This is a React TypeScript project that simulates weaving patterns using p5.js.

### Important Instructions

1. **Always run `npm test` after making code edits** - This runs TypeScript type checking to ensure code quality and catch type errors early.

2. **Development Commands:**
   - `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
   - `npm run build` - Build for production (suitable for GitHub Pages)
   - `npm test` - Run TypeScript type checking

3. **Project Structure:**
   - Uses Vite as the build tool
   - React with TypeScript
   - p5.js for canvas rendering
   - Configured for GitHub Pages deployment

### Testing Workflow

After any code changes:
```bash
npm test
```

This ensures all TypeScript types are correct before committing changes.
